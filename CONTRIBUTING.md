# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how to get started.

## Workflow
- Fork the repo and create a branch per change
- Update docs alongside code
- Run the demo harness (if present)
- Open a pull request with a clear description of the change

## Guidelines
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change
- Include tests or examples where applicable
- Follow the existing code and documentation style

## Pre-Submit Checklist
- Verify docs contain no internal domains or IPs
- Ensure your changes work with a clean install
